#  Loan Risk Analysis Project — Master Table Creation + Initial Data Validation

##  Project Overview
This project is a **loan risk analysis** project based on real-world banking data.  
In this project, I will analyze raw banking datasets and create a **Loan Master Table from scratch** using **SQL ETL logic**.

##  Business Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a dataset and analytics pipeline that can help in **loan risk prediction** using banking behavior data such as:
- loan details  
- account behavior  
- transaction patterns  
- customer linking  
- demographic and regional risk factors

##  Raw Tables Used (Banking Dataset)
The dataset contains multiple relational tables that represent different banking entities:

- `loan` → loan information and target loan status  
- `account` → account details  
- `client` → customer details  
- `disp` → relation between account and client (who owns the account)  
- `transaction_data` → transaction history and balances  
- `orders` → permanent orders/payment instructions  
- `card` → card information  
- `district` → district-level socio-economic attributes
